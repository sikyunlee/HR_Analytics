# HRAnalytics
 HR Analytics Project based on IBM HR Analytics Dataset on Kaggle to understand what are some key features and pain points HR professionals may consider when tring to retain employees within an organization. 
 This notebook with results in both HTML and a PDF version goes into a quick exploratory data analysis to understand the data in the following terms:
 - Basic Data Checks 
 - Attribution by Job Roles, Job Satisfaction, and other features
 - Cohort Analysis by Years Working for that Company before Churn
 A quick prediction in Attribution was made through Random Forest, but this does not consider time-series based aspects since employees would not churn away at the same time. 
 
 Overall, this gives intuitive ideas in which features HR professionals may have to consider in employee retention and insights on how these could be improved.
